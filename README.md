# munin-plugins

This is a central repository for my own munin plugins.

Every plugin contains a README explaining how to install the specific plugin.

## Installation

I'd recommend to clone the entire directory to a place like `/usr/share/munin/munin-plugins` and just symlink the plugins to your munin directory, usually located at `/etc/munin/plugins`.
